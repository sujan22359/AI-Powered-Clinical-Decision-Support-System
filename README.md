                         - Threshold Evaluator
                         - Risk Explainer
```

### Threshold-Based Risk Assessment Pipeline

The system uses a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline for automated clinical parameter evaluation:

1. **Parameter Extraction**: Identifies clinical parameters (glucose, cholesterol, etc.) and their values from text
2. **Reference Range Lookup**: Retrieves evidence-based normal ranges from built-in database
3. **Unit Conversion**: Automatically converts between measurement systems (US ↔ SI units)
4. **Threshold Evaluation**: Compares values against ranges and categorizes risk levels
5. **Risk Explanation**: Generates patient-friendly explanations with specific details
6. **Risk Merging**: Combines threshold-based and AI-detected risks, removing duplicates

## 🎯 Threshold-Based Risk Assessment

### Overview

The Clinical Report Analyzer includes an advanced threshold-based risk assessment system that automatically evaluates clinical parameters against evidence-based reference ranges. This provides objective, quantitative risk assessment alongside AI-powered analysis.

### Supported Parameters

The system includes reference ranges for 20+ common clinical parameters:

**Glucose Metabolism:**
- Blood Glucose (Fasting)
- Hemoglobin A1c

**Lipid Panel:**
- Total Cholesterol
- LDL Cholesterol
- HDL Cholesterol
- Triglycerides

**Kidney Function:**
- Creatinine
- Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
- Estimated GFR (eGFR)

**Complete Blood Count:**
- Hemoglobin
- Hematocrit
- White Blood Cell Count
- Platelet Count

**Vital Signs:**
- Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)
- Heart Rate

**Liver Function:**
- ALT, AST, Bilirubin

**Thyroid Function:**
- TSH

**And more...**

### Unit Conversion Support

The system automatically handles unit conversions between US and international (SI) units:

- **Glucose:** mg/dL ↔ mmol/L
- **Cholesterol:** mg/dL ↔ mmol/L
- **Creatinine:** mg/dL ↔ μmol/L
- **Hemoglobin:** g/dL ↔ g/L

### Risk Categorization

Parameters are categorized into three risk levels:

- **LOW (Green):** Value within normal range
- **MEDIUM (Yellow):** Value outside normal range but not critical (requires attention)
- **HIGH (Red):** Value critically abnormal (requires immediate attention)

**Critical Thresholds:**
- HIGH risk: >50% deviation from normal range boundaries
- MEDIUM risk: Outside normal range but <50% deviation

### Example Output

For a patient with elevated glucose:

```
🟡 MEDIUM RISK (Metabolic) 📊 Threshold-Based
Blood Glucose: 110.0 mg/dL (Normal: 70.0-100.0 mg/dL)

Parameter: Blood Glucose
Your Value: 110.0 mg/dL
Normal Range: 70.0-100.0 mg/dL
Deviation: 10.0% above normal

Details: Your Blood Glucose level is 110.0 mg/dL, which is above the 
normal range. Your value is approximately 10.0% above the normal threshold. 
While not critical, this should be discussed with your healthcare provider 
to determine if any action is needed.
```

### Benefits

1. **Objective Assessment:** Quantitative evaluation based on established medical standards
2. **Detailed Information:** Specific values, ranges, and deviation percentages
3. **Patient-Friendly:** Clear explanations without medical jargon
4. **Comprehensive:** Covers multiple body systems and parameter types
5. **Accurate:** Handles unit conversions and edge cases properly
6. **Complementary:** Works alongside AI analysis for comprehensive insights

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**

- Check Python dependencies are installed

**Frontend can't connect:**
- Ensure backend is running on localhost:8000
- Check firewall settings
- Verify CORS configuration

**Analysis fails:**
- Check Google Gemini API key validity
- Verify document format (PDF/DOCX only)
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Review error messages for specific guidance
